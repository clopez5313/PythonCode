* max() returns the biggest element in a list, min() returns the smallest.
* len() returns the number of elements in the object.
* x = int(x), x = float(x) convert the variable into the assigned type.

* 'continue' is used to end the current iteration without exiting the while loop. It proceeds with the next iteration.
* word[i:j] retrieves the characters between i and j-1.
* dir() can be used to list the available methods of an object.
* strip() is used to remove the blank spaces at the beginning and the end of a string. rstrip() removes the spaces on the right side of a string.
* %d, %g, and %s can be used to format strings.
 'In %d I got a %g grade on %s.' % (2010,9.5,'math class')
* open(file location) is used to open a file. If it succeeds, a file handle is returned.
* If the size of the file is small enough, it can be read in one string using read().
* find() looks for occurrences of a string within another string. Returns the position of the string or -1 if it wasn't found.
* Protecting the open() call with a Try/Except is a good practice.
* To write a file, it has to be opened like this: open(file location, w). If the file already exists, the contents will be deleted and replaced with
  the new text.
* write() puts the data in the file and returns the number of characters written.
* close() needs to be used when writing files.
* A list is a sequence of elements, which can be of any type. The list can have elements of many types.
* Unlike strings, lists are mutable.
* append() adds an element at the end of a list.
* extend(list) takes a list as an argument and adds it at the end of the list that calls the method.
* sort() arranges the elements in the list from high to low.
* pop(index) can be used to delete elements in a list. It returns the removed element. If an index is not given, it deletes and returns the last
  element of the list.
* If the element is not needed, then del list[index] can be used instead.
* remove(element) can be used if the element is known but not the index.
* To remove more than one element at the same time, 'del' with a slice index can be used.
* sum() only works on lists when the elements are numbers.
* To convert from a string to a list (array) of characters, list(string) can be used.
* split() is used to break a string into words. It can use an optional argument called delimiter that specifies which characters are used as words
  boundaries.
* join(list) takes a list of strings to concatenate the elements of that list.
* 'is' can be used to determine if two variables refer to the same object.
* When a list is passed as argument to a function, the function gets a reference to the list. If the function modifies a list parameter, the caller
  of the function sees the change.
* append() modifies a list, while the '+' operator creates a new list.
* A dictionary is a more general type of list. Their indices can be almost of any type.
* Dictionaries can be seen as mappings between a set of keys (indices) and a set of values.
* Square brackets can be used to add items to a dictionary: dict[key]=value
* The order of items in a dictionary is unpredictable. That's why keys are used to look for corresponding values.
* On dictionaries, len() returns the number of key-value pairs.
* The 'in' operator tells whether something appears as key in the dictionary.
* To see whether something appears as a value, the values() method needs to be used. It returns an object that can be converted to list, and then the
  'in' operator can be used again.
* get(key, value) checks if the key appears in the dictionary. If it does, returns the corresponding value, otherwise returns the default value.
* A tuple is a sequence of values. The values stored in a tuple can be of any type and they are indexed by integers. Tuples are immutable though.
* Create a tuple with a single element: t = (element,)
* Create an empty tuple: t = tuple()
* If the argument in tuple(object) is a sequence (string, list, or another tuple), the result of the call is a tuple with the elements of the sequence.
* Comparison on tuples: compares the elements of each sequence in ascending order until it finds elements that differ. Subsequent elements are not
  considered.
* Dictionaries have a method called items() that return a list of tuples, where each tuple is a key-value pair.
* To use the regular expressions library, 're' has to be imported.
* The caret character (^) is used in regular expressions to match the beginning of a line.
* The most common special character used in regular expressions is the period (.), which matches any character.
* '*' is used to match zero or more characters in the search string. '+' is used to match one or more characters.
* findall() can be used to extract all of the substrings that match a regular expression.
* In the expression '\S+@\S+' we look for substrings that have at least one non-whitespace character, followed by an at-sign, followed by at least
  one non-whitespace character. '\S+' matches as many non-whitespace characters as possible.
* Square brackets ('[]') are used to indicate a set of multiple acceptable characters we are willing to consider matching.
* When using findall(), parentheses indicate that while you want the whole expression to match, you only are interested in extracting a portion
  of the substring that matches the regular expression.
* Other special characters and character sequences in regular expressions:
  '$' matches end of line
  \s matches whitespace character
  *? and +? use non-greedy mode to match the characters
  '?' matches a character zero or one time
  [^] when the caret is used in square brackets, it inverts the logic of the acceptable characters.
  \b matches the empty string but only at the start or end of a word
  \B matches the empty string but not at the start or end of a word
  \d matches any decimal digit (equivalent of [0-9])
  \D matches any non-digit character (equivalent to [^0-9])
* A socket provides a two-way connection between two programs. You can both read and write to the same socket.
* encode() converts strings into bytes, while decode() does the opposite.
* Flow Control is pausing either the sending or the receiving application.
* The 'urllib' library simplifies the process of sending and receiving data over HTTP. It treats a web page much like a file.
* To avoid running out of memory when retrieving a file, the data is pulled in buffers and then written to the disk before retrieving the next one.
* A non-greedy match tries to find the smallest possible matching string, while the greedy tries to find the largest.
* There are many Python libraries that can help to parse HTML and extract data from the pages.
* To install packages in Python, make sure that these tools are up to date:
  python -m pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel
* Two common formats are used when exchanging data across the web: XML and JSON.
* XML is best suited to exchange document-style data, while JSON works better with dictionaries, lists or other type of internal information.
* When we use an API, usually one program makes a set of services available for use by other applications and publishes the APIs (rules, contract)
  that must be followed to access the provided services.
* A SOA (Service-oriented architecture) approach is one where our overall application makes use of the services of other applications.
* When building objects, 'class' is used to define the data and code that will make up each of the objects.
* 'class' does not create objects but it rather defines a template indicating what data and code will be contained in each object.
* '__init__' and '__del__' are used if the objects need to be aware about Construction and Destruction times.
